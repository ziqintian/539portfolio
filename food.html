            <h2>Pink Drink</h2>
            <p>Pink Drink is a popular Starbucks Refresher beverage made with ice, 
                Strawberry Acai Base, Coconutmilk (Starbucks coconut milk blend), and freeze-dried strawberries. 
                It’s a caffeinated drink since there is caffeine in the Strawberry Acai Base.</p>
            <h2>Ice Cream Truck</h2>
            <p>The ice cream truck is a commercial vehicle that serves as a mobile retail outlet for ice cream, 
                usually during the spring and summer. Ice cream vans are often seen parked at public events, or near parks, 
                beaches, or other areas where people congregate. Ice cream vans often travel near where children play — outside schools, 
                in residential areas, or in other locations.</p>
